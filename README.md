# Stock Market Prediction and Automated Investment  

## Project Overview  
This project uses machine learning to predict stock market trends and automate investments. The model is trained on historical Apple (AAPL) stock data and forecasts future prices. It compares predicted values to actual market trends to measure accuracy. The system is designed for both **trend prediction** and **automated investment simulation**.  

## Features  
- **Custom Machine Learning Model**: Predicts future stock prices based on historical data.  
- **Historical Data Analysis**: Uses data from the 1980s to 2000 to predict stock prices from 2000 to 2017.  
- **Model Evaluation**: Compares predictions against actual results to measure variation loss.  
- **Automated & Manual Training**:  
  - `aapltrain.py` - Trains the model on a single dataset.  
  - `aapltrainautomated.py` - Runs multiple training sessions with different hyperparameters.  
- **Graphical Analysis**: Displays results to track accuracy over time.

## Installation & Requirements  
⚠️ *Dependencies and installation steps are yet to be determined. Update this section later.*  

## Usage  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo.git
   cd yourrepo
   ```
2. Run training:  
   ```bash
   python aapltrain.py
   ```
3. Run automated training:  
   ```bash
   python aapltrainautomated.py
   ```

## Evaluation & Results  
- The model is tested by predicting stock values from **2000 to 2017**, using data from **1980s to 2000** for training.  
- The predicted values are plotted next to actual stock prices to analyze accuracy.  

## Next Steps  
- Implement an **investment simulation system** based on predictions.  
- Fine-tune **hyperparameters** for better accuracy.  
- Expand to **real-time stock market data integration**.

## How to Push Everything to GitHub  
After copying and pasting the project files into your local repository, run the following commands:  

```bash
git init   # If this is a new repository
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - Stock market prediction project"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo.git  # Replace with your repo URL
git push -u origin main
```

This will upload everything to your GitHub repository. Let me know if you need any changes! 🚀
